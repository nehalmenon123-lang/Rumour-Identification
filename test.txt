## Model Details

We evaluated several models on a balanced dataset:

| Model                | Accuracy | Precision | Recall | F1-Score |
|----------------------|----------|-----------|--------|----------|
| Logistic Regression | 0.92     | 0.91      | 0.93   | 0.92     |
| Naive Bayes         | 0.89     | 0.88      | 0.90   | 0.89     |
| Random Forest       | 0.94     | 0.93      | 0.95   | 0.94     |
| SVM                 | 0.93     | 0.92      | 0.94   | 0.93     |
| LSTM                | 0.95     | 0.94      | 0.96   | 0.95     |
| CNN (Best)          | 0.96     | 0.95      | 0.97   | 0.96     |

### Confusion Matrix for CNN
|                  | Predicted: Rumor | Predicted: Non-Rumor |
|------------------|------------------|----------------------|
| Actual: Rumor    | 430              | 20                   |
| Actual: Non-Rumor| 15               | 535                  |

CNN was selected for its ability to capture complex text patterns with low latency.

## Results and Analysis

- **Accuracy Comparison**:

Error analysis reveals challenges with sarcasm and ambiguous language; future iterations could incorporate sentiment analysis.

## Literature Review

## Future Work

As outlined in the project report:
- **Multimodal Integration**: Add image/video analysis for deepfakes.
- **User Feedback Loop**: Allow reporting inaccuracies for model retraining.
- **Network Analysis**: Incorporate graph-based propagation tracking.
- **Real-Time Updates**: CI/CD for automated retraining.
- **Ethical Considerations**: Bias audits and privacy compliance.
